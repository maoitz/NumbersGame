Welcome to the numbers game!

It's a very simple game-loop that runs in the console where you guess a randomized number. 
As with most games, the user can choose to either play or quit from a main menu which 
is prompted when you start the program. The user can then choose between 3 difficulties
which defines the range of the random number, aswell as how many tries the user gets.

After each guess (unless its correct) feedback is provided by the console based on how close
the guess was to the correct number. If max tries is made the user lose the game and is returned
to the difficulty menu. Each input is validated by a method to make sure right
type of input is made and all the logic is divided in methods.
